    <p>This website has been created as learning and informative purposes.</p>

    <p>
        Learning purposes as it has been created by a current IT student and is still a work in progress. The idea was to learn how to create a website using Symfony framework. The creator thought "Why not learn and make it useful for others as well?!" And so the skycellar.co.nz has discovered the web.</p>

    <p>
        Informative purposes as this website just give information about wine and nothing else. It can be used by anyone who wants to learn more about wine.
    </p>

    <p>
        However as work in progress, more features will appear and it will become a more complete website.
        I thank you for your understanding and I hope you will enjoy browsing through this site.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stay tune and visit the site often to discover new features and new wines!!
